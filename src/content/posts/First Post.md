It's been a long time since I was willing to make a personal blog site for myself, and finally here I am. This is my first post on this website. I made this website to write about the stuff I love to read, work on, and do. Most of them are going to be technical things related to programming, which includes programming languages I learn, frameworks, and my experience in this programming journey. My only goal is to write about things that will be helpful for at least one person.

### What Am I Using to Make This Site?

I'm using [Astro](https://astro.build) to build this website. Astro is absolutely amazing and really great for content-driven sites like this, and it's blazingly fast. It is really easy and fast to work with Astro. I could have used Next.js for this as well, but as most of my personal projects are built with [React](https://react.dev) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), I thought this time I'd learn something new and build with it. I'm really happy that I chose Astro for this one. Astro's `Content Collections` is really great when it comes to building blog sites and provides automatic TypeScript `type-safety` for all of your content. We will talk more about Astro later in some posts.

For deployment, I'm using [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

Thanks for reading ❤️
