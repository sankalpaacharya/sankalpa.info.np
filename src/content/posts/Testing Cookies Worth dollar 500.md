Hey everyone, I‚Äôm Sankalpa Acharya from Nepal. A few weeks ago, I discovered an IDOR vulnerability that was worth $500 to me. So, let‚Äôs kick off my journey with this first bounty!

<b>Impact of Vulnerability</b>: Account Takeover

Before diving straight into the report, I have a tip for those who are struggling to get their first bounty. If you‚Äôre finding bugs on targets available in HackerOne and Bugcrowd, consider switching your target. Use Google dorks (inurl: /responsible-disclosure/ bounty) to discover some bug bounty programs because there is less competition, and as a beginner, that‚Äôs what you want.

Let‚Äôs Begin,

I have a bad habit of continuously changing targets without even proper recon. While searching for reports about SSO login vulnerabilities, I came across a website in my search results: ‚Äòsso.example.io‚Äô (can‚Äôt disclose the website name). This time, I had a strong gut feeling that I might find a vulnerability in this target.

I created two accounts there, at first I tested CSRF vulnerability but no luck :(

Then I went to test password reset functionality hopping any OTP code or token might get leaked in Referer header or in Response again no luck :(

Again:

With a slight trace of sadness on my face, I decided to observe the login flow of the website. I was hoping to discover JWT misconfiguration if the website used JWT tokens to identify users. I intercepted the request after entering my ID and password and clicked the ‚ÄòLogin‚Äô button, but there wasn‚Äôt much in the request. When I intercepted the response, I found that there was no JWT token or any other code in the response body :(

What identifies the user to the browser? Cookies, right? So, I began testing the cookies.

![burp](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*fLp0p63xrU2fsF3x8YgYxg.jpeg)

So, I replaced every cookie header one by one with those from my other account. There was a ‚ÄúSet-Cookie‚Äù header: example_token=token, which was identifying the user. I decided to delve deeper into this header. Within it, there were some random tokens separated like this ‚Üí 1|random_string_and_integer|5-digit code|5-digit code|random_string_and_integer|. One thing that caught my eye was that 5-digit code because it was repeated in the header, and there was only one letter different from my second account.

As you can see in the token header, a 5-digit code (47402) was being repeated, and my second account had the code 47403. So, I replaced that 5-digit code with my second account‚Äôs code, and‚Ä¶ Boooooooom!!!! My second account was logged in. To be doubly sure, I replaced that code (47402) with 47401, and then I was logged into another user‚Äôs account from China. Yessssssssssss, I did it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Then, I reported the vulnerability.
